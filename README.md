A script that scrapes eBay stores information based on supplied keywords.

  <li>business description</li>
  <li>business owner user name</li>
  <li>store feedback score</li>

  </ol>
  
  To use, in the Terminal, in the folder containing the **ebayBusiness.py** file, type **<i>python3 ebayBusiness.py</i>**.
  Then type the keywords for the business when prompted. Details of the stores will be downloaded and saved in a CSV file.
  For example, if one is interested in the data of the stores selling marine-related items, supply 'marine' as keyword.
  
  An example result (eBay stores selling flags) is also included here (example.csv).
